## Development

### Quick Start

> Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maygo/tockler.git  # Download this project

npm install yarn -g     # install yarn or binary from https://yarnpkg.com
```

### Start application

Renderer and main process builds have been separated. It's easier to boilerplate this project and switch client framework.

#### React client (renderer)

```
cd client/
yarn install            # Install dependencies
npm start
```

#### Electron (main)

```
cd electron/
yarn install            # Install dependencies
yarn start
```

Build scripts samples are in travis/appveyor files.
